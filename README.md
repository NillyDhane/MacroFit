Claude Prompt (Used for Recipe Generation) :
â€œ
I need you to generate a JSON representation of a meal database based on a Swift data structure. The structure includes a collection of meals with specific properties and helper functions to filter meals by dietary restrictions and meal type. 
Please generate a JSON file that represents the meals array from the MockData struct. The JSON should include all 12 meals with the following properties for each meal:
name (String)
imageName (String)
calories (Integer)
protein (Integer)
carbs (Integer)
fats (Integer)
mealType (String, e.g., "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", "vegetarian", "snack", "preworkout", "postworkout")
ingredients (Array of Strings)
instructions (Array of Strings)
prepTime (Integer, in minutes)
restrictions (Array of Strings, e.g., "vegetarian", "vegan", "dairyFree", "glutenFree", "nutFree")

*image unable to be attached due to being in Readme, original images supplied in the final report*

Ensure the JSON maintains the same data as the Swift code, including all 12 meals with their respective values. The output should be a single JSON object with a meals key containing an array of meal objects. Use proper JSON formatting with no trailing commas, and ensure all values match the original Swift data exactly."
